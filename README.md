# Facebook

> Facebook clone web app.

The following steps will walk you thru installation on a Mac. I think linux should be similar. It's also possible to develop on a Windows machine, but I have not documented the steps. If you've developed the app on Windows, you should have little problem getting up and running.

```bash
cd https://github.com/mbrsagor/fb-clone.git
cd fb-clone
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
